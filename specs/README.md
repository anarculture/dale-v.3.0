# Specifications

This directory contains the specifications for the Dale v3 project, following
the **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** methodology.

## Workflow

1. **Draft**: Create a new markdown file in this directory (e.g.,
   `001-feature-name.md`) using `template.md`.
2. **Review**: The user and AI review the specification to ensure it captures
   the requirements, context, and constraints.
3. **Plan**: The AI generates an implementation plan based on the spec.
4. **Implement**: The AI implements the changes following the plan.
5. **Verify**: The AI verifies the changes against the spec's acceptance
   criteria.

## Structure

- `template.md`: The template for new specifications.
- `XXX-name.md`: Numbered specifications for features or tasks.
